# Fortnite-like Building and Editing

This is a project I started like 2 years ago or so.
There's a lot of spaguetti code and honestly even tho refactoring seems tempting there's hundreds of lines and currently only god knows how in the hell this works (kinda bcs there are still some bugs).

**Anyways** I will try to do it and not die.
